# Data Analysis for Gamma-ray Astronomy, Spring 2023
Gamma-ray astronomy studies the most energetic events in the Universe, from searching for primordial black holes to detecting the giant molecular clouds illuminated by ultra-high energy particles.

In this workshop, we will learn the applied mathematical and computational techniques in gamma-ray astronomy, including gamma-ray shower reconstruction, background estimation, and physical model fitting.

We will also discuss how this knowledge is being applied in other fields of large data.

Together weâ€™ll use Python to engage in a short exercise of a simplified gamma-ray analysis to give participants a first-hand experience of gamma-ray astronomy.

This workshop is taught by Ruo-Yu Shang, Postdoctoral Fellow, and Reshmi Mukherjee, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Barnard College.
